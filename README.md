# laplace-transform-cpp
The Laplace Transform is used to convert a continuous time domain(t) into a complex frequency domain(S) which makes differential equations easier to solve.

This Python script finds the S domain of the differential equation. Currently, this script only works with simple, homogeneous equations. I plan on adding support for cauchy-euler equations and nonhomogeneous equations later.
