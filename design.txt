I'm gonna get my hands dirty with the standard library.
What if I do this in assembly, AT&T Syntax?

Global Vars:
float euler = 2.7182818;
float mascheroni = 0.577215664901;

Functions:
- Integrate(definite)
- Clean-poly
  
Here is how the program will work:
Might need a table or just use the integral
  
SEPARATE BY SPACE:
After antiderivative, if anything is divided by 0, it will output "diverges." If any numerator is infinity, it will output "diverges." If 0 before a non-number, get rid of the term.
